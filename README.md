# Wat Dis?

Essentially, as the name implies, it's just a project I intend
to use as a "live ammunition" for learning Jenkins, i.e.
one needs an actual functioning application so that it is
as clear as possible if it's a CI pipeline that doesn't work
or the app itself

Needless to say, right now it **is** the app itself, of course,
as I decided to take an idea I have already implemented but
wanted to improve upon etc., so why not combine the two?

As per the specifics: the `keyvastopy` app is
`key-value` pair storage aka Redis from Wish.com or something
to that effect, hence `KeyVa(l)Sto(re)Py`

TODO:

- [ ] Get the app to actual working state
- [ ] Add an API (probably FastAPI-based,
  already did it with Flask)
- [X] A task marked done which in fact was never a task
