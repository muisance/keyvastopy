# Wat Dis?

Essentially, as the name implies, it's just a project I intend
to use as a "live ammunition" for learning Jenkins, i.e.
one needs an actual functioning application so that it is
as clear as possible if it's a CI pipeline that doesn't work
or the app itself

Needless to say, right now it **is** the app itself, of course,
as I decided to take an idea I have already implemented but
wanted to improve upon etc., so why not combine the two?

As per the specifics: the `keyvastopy` app is
`key-value` pair storage aka Redis from Wish.com or something
to that effect, hence `KeyVa(l)Sto(re)Py`

TODO:

- [x] Get the app to actual working state
      (it does work, and actually **most**
      of the planned functionality **is**
      already operational, just not **ALL**
      of it)
- [ ] Add an _API_ (probably FastAPI-based,
      already did it with Flask)
- [ ] Make `write_key_val_pair_to_storage` actually functional
- [ ] Implement custom path functionality
- [X] A task marked done which in fact was never a task
